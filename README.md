# MoviETL-Data-Pipeline
Crafted an ETL pipeline to handle 26 million user ratings and about 45,000 movies. The pipeline has the potential of ingesting data at an efficiency of 10,000 records per minute into AWS Redshift. Implemented a standardized data model and automated data quality checks using Airflow, contributing to a 97% success rate for regular ETL cycles.
